# Power BI Dashboard Instructions

This guide walks you through importing the forecast data and building the dashboard in Power BI Desktop.

## Prerequisites
- Power BI Desktop installed.
- `data/forecast_results.csv` generated by running the Python model.

## Step 1: Import Data
1. Open Power BI Desktop.
2. Click **Get Data** > **Text/CSV**.
3. Browse to `data/forecast_results.csv` in your project folder and select it.
4. Click **Load**.

## Step 2: Create Measures (Optional but Recommended)
- **Total Sales**: `Sum('forecast_results'[Actual_Sales])`
- **Forecasted Sales**: `Sum('forecast_results'[Predicted_Sales])`

## Step 3: Build Visualizations

### 1. Sales Trend Line (Actual vs Forecast)
- **Visual Type**: Line Chart
- **X-Axis**: `Date`
- **Y-Axis**: `Actual_Sales` and `Predicted_Sales` (drag both fields here)
- ** formatting**:
    - Change `Actual_Sales` color to Blue.
    - Change `Predicted_Sales` color to Orange (or a dashed line to indicate forecast).
- **Tip**: You might see a gap where actuals end and forecast begins. Ensure your model output covers this, or graph them as continuous lines if they overlap.

### 2. Confidence Intervals (optional)
- Add `Lower_Bound` and `Upper_Bound` to the tooltip or as error bands if using a custom visual, or simply plot them as light grey lines to show the range.

### 3. Key Performance Indicators (Cards)
- **Card 1**: Total Actual Sales (Historical)
- **Card 2**: Total Forecasted Sales (Next 12 Months)

### 4. Slicers
- Add a **Date Slicer** to filter by year/month.
- If your CSV includes `Category` or `Region`, add slicers for those to allow dynamic filtering (Note: The basic Prophet model in this example might be an aggregate forecast. for granular filtering, you would need to generate forecasts per category).

## Step 4: Polish and Publish
- Add a title: "Sales Forecasting Dashboard".
- Align visuals neatly.
- Save your `.pbix` file.
